<h2>Q1 = Create one function with zero parameter having a console statement  </h2>
<div id="zero">= value printed in console At line no.5</div>

<h2>Q2 = Create one function which takes two values as a parameter and print the sum of them as "Sum of 3, 4 is 7"</h2>
<div id="zero">= value printed in console At line no.14</div>

<h2>Q4 = "Print output: 
        var x = 21;
        var girl = function () {
            console.log(x);
            var x = 20;
        };
        girl ();"</h2>

        <p>Reason: The output value is Undefined because when the execution context was running ,before it could 
            assign value to x, the x was called(console.log x).  </p>


<hr>
    
<h2>Q5 = "Print output: 
    var x = 21;
    girl ();
    console.log(x)
    function girl() {
        console.log(x);
        var x = 20;
    };
    "</h2>
    <p> In the process of process of memory allocation the function was skipped after var x = 21, and then
        there was console.log(x), So the execution context took the first declared value of x and printed in the output.</p>
<hr>  
<h2>Q6 = "Print output

    var x = 21;
    a();
    b();
    
      function a() {
        
       x = 20;
      console.log(x);
    };
     function b() {
        
        x = 40;
       console.log(x);
    };"</h2> 

<p>Reason: In the M.A execution context the x value printed as 21, then in the a function where the x was 
    declared 20 before console.log(x) so the after execution of function scope the value of x which was 20 
    and it was near so it printed x = 20. Same with the case of 40.</p>
